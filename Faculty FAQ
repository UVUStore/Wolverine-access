    </a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqH">
      <br>
      <p>The Wolverine Access program is designed to ensure that all students have access to required course materials by the first day of classes for a flat fee. For faculty, this means every student is equally prepared, which can lead to a more uniform and effective teaching experience. It helps reduce the number of students falling behind due to lack of access to textbooks, potentially improving overall academic performance and retention rates.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faq1">
      <br>
        <p>No, faculty retain full academic freedom under this program and can continue selecting the materials that best suit their course. All textbooks remain available for adoption, whether they are publisher-paid content or free/open educational resources (OER).</p>

          <p>Only required titles are included in the program; optional/recommended, out-of-print, and hard-to-find titles are not included in the program.</p>

    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faq2">

    </div>
    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faq3">
      <br>
          <p>Please submit your book requests to your department administrative assistant. Faculty are still required to submit their textbook adoptions by the established deadlines. The program simplifies the process by ensuring that once materials are adopted, they are automatically made available to students enrolled in your course. Faculty members should ensure they submit accurate and complete information to avoid any delays in material availability.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqC">
      <br>
      <p>Students initially access eBooks directly through Textbooks & Course Materials in Canvas. After initial access, a student may continue to access through your Canvas course or by logging in directly to their <a href="https://www.vitalsource.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #0e8345;">VitalSource</a> account. eBooks provided by VitalSource can be downloaded to any device and across devices for offline use. At the conclusion of a term, eBooks may be accessed through VitalSource until the eBook’s duration expires. 
<br><br>
Publisher courseware (such as McGraw-Hill Connect or Pearson MyLab) is accessed through an integration in Canvas or with a provided URL. Most publisher courseware is integrated with Canvas to connect to the publisher’s content platform and students will use the Canvas link to create their initial courseware login. After an initial login has been created, students may go directly to or bookmark the login page of the publisher’s content platform. 
<br><br>
For non-digital course materials (only those titles offered as print), copies will be distributed to students by the UVU Store.</p>

    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqD">
      <br>
      <p>Access duration depends on the publisher, with most eBooks being lifetime access and others being five years. All eBooks have a minimum access duration of 150 days.

Courseware is typically only accessible for one semester unless otherwise negotiated with a publisher for a multi-semester course series.</p>

    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqw">
      <br>
      <p>Wolverine Access reduces the digital divide in several ways: </p>
      <p>Most courses require students to access course information on Canvas. By integrating a student’s textbooks and course materials within Canvas, we are reducing the amount of digital software requirements that could burden students. </p>
    <p>Wolverine Access also integrates with all laptops, tablets, and phones. This allows the students to access their materials from any device they choose. This means they can access materials from their personal devices or any devices provided by computer labs at Utah Valley University. </p>
    <p>Wolverine Access helps those students who live in remote areas, who may struggle to come to campus to get materials, and who struggle with added shipping costs.</p>

      <p>The VitalSource eReader is fully device-agnostic and scalable and allows simultaneous usage across two mobile devices and two desktop devices. Further, content downloaded to the eReader app can be accessed offline if it was downloaded before the loss of internet connection. As for saving as a file, copyright laws can restrict licensed content from taking the form of re-distributable files. Allowing content to only be downloaded within the eReader puts the onus on the provider to protect copyright and relieves the University of associated risks.</p>

      <p>Faculty are still required to submit their textbook adoptions by the established deadlines.

        <p>Yes, faculty have the freedom to choose the textbooks and materials they feel are most appropriate for their courses.

      <p>If your course requires specialized materials that aren’t covered by the Wolverine Access program (e.g., lab kits, art supplies, goggles, latex gloves, lab coats, etc.), you should inform students ahead of time. These materials will need to be purchased separately, and clear communication about these requirements is crucial to avoid confusion.</p>

      <p>If changes to course materials are necessary after the adoption deadline, faculty should contact the UVU Store as soon as possible.

      <p>Faculty cannot opt out of the Wolverine Access program on behalf of their students.

    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqy">
      <br>
      <p>Auxiliary enterprises operate as essential elements in support of the mission of the university. Auxiliary Services typically generate their own revenue and do not rely on direct state funding. These services are designed to be self-supporting, and they often receive funding through margins charged to students, staff, faculty, and other consumers. Auxiliary enterprises are expected to pay their appropriate share of costs for physical plant operations and other directly chargeable support costs related to their operation. In addition, auxiliary enterprises shall pay an appropriate share of the university's other administrative support costs. </p>

   <h2>Why do affordable access programs automatically bill students unless they opt out?</h2>
    </a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse inner-text" id="faqY">
      <br>
     <p>The opt-out structure ensures that campuses have the economies of scale necessary to secure bulk discounts from publishers and other suppliers, it also guarantees that students have their required materials automatically on or before the first day of classes. Students have two to three weeks before the opt-out deadline to comparison shop and make sure they are getting their materials for the lowest price.</p>
 
    <p>When negotiating with publishers, institutions can achieve significant savings in an opt-out program and better terms, as it is operationally more efficient than an opt-in program, and that savings can be realized by institutions and students. On average, opt-out access programs save students an average of 59.4 percent compared to new print list prices (PLP) and 30.8 percent from digital list prices (DLP).  </p>
